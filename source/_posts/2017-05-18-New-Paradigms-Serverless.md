Around six months back I came across concept of “Serverless” and since very that day it has fascinated me. My instincts have been sighting this this is future of “Software Engineering” and “App Development". And yes its a talk of the town today! It has already become hot topic in the software architecture world. Already there are many books, meetups & conferences about this subject. 

Serverless - does not mean there are no servers, but its a notion in which code is written & executed by abstracting underlying processes, operating systems, servers or virtual machines. Developer don’t have to worry about all this, just write code and execute it in the cloud. So nice! So easy! and So Clean!

Lets deep dive - Serverless Architecture mainly refers to two modern cloud computing concepts BaaS and FaaS. 

BaaS -   Backend as a service is a cloud computing service model that serves as the middleware that provides developers with ways to connect their Web and mobile applications to cloud services via application programming interfaces (API) and software developers' kits (SDK). Compared to other service models in the cloud computing environment, BaaS is rather new and there is a limited number of available providers.
