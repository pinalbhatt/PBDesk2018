Yes I am moving my blog(blog.PBDesk.com) from WordPress to Jekyll and host it at Github pages.

One more jump for my blog. I started blogging since 2007 using Google's blogger and to start with it was really easy and simple start. 
And continued using it till 2013. Huh! Pretty long time. But in mean time I thought of moving it to WordPress as that was the most used 
blogging engine and the main thing that tempted me to move to WordPress was whole world of plugins support. 
And by end of 2013 I moved to self hosted WordPress blog at blog.PBDesk.com. But very soon I started to realize that thorns 
always come with roses. Easily installable plugins, very soon, made my system complex and started breaking frequently due to 
incompatible version upgrades. Moreover PHP was not my forte so making any change at code level was not that easy for me. 
And finally being self hosted site I  have to take care of site and DB backups. Was not able to keep up with all this,  
and so waanted to move again to something simple.  And found [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - from Github team.   

Best part of Jekyll was its simplicity - everything was in files and git and no database. No worry of backups as its all in 
git and can be hosted as Github pages free of cost so even no hosting cost. That was the coolest part. Yes there was bit of 
learning curve for me as Jekyll is Ruby based and uses Liquid templating engine, but that was not difficult job for me - those 
who know me very well know that I am always on learning ramp.
